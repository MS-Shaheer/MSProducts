# MSProducts

Simple application through which we can add, update, delete different products. In short it does CRUD operations using Angular as its frontend and Flask as its backend with SQLite3 as database.

Made this project to continue my learning in angular and flask. Feel free to customize and modify the description according to your preferences and project specifics.

Development server
Backend
Run python app.py for running backend, so that frontend can get data from backend. It will start http://127.0.0.1:5000 you can go to /products to have a look at JSON objects.

Frontend
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Code scaffolding
Run ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.

Build
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.

Running unit tests
Run ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.

Running end-to-end tests
Run ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.
